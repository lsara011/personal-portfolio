        <p>My name is Luis Saravia. I was born in Little Havana within the beautiful city of Miami.
          I was raised in Plantation, FL where i spent most of my childhood in. I like to play Football, play music,
          learning how to code, and spending time with family and friends. I work full time at Kush Hospitality Services as a Cook while studying Software Engineering
          in school. </p>

        <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>I am passionate about technology and its continuous evolution. I find the incredible advancements in this field fascinating. For instance, in the past, we relied on paper maps for navigation, but now, we have large screens in malls that provide real-time guidance and even track our movements. These innovations inspire me to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, where I hope to contribute to the ongoing technological revolution and leave a positive impact on society</p>
